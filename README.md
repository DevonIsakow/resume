### Personal Statement
I am a data analyst with 3 years of experience in SQL and using production like databases to track usage and drive product development. My main focus when working with a team is to figure out *why* they want the numbers they are requesting, and to see if I can generalize the analysis to make it self service. I believe that everyone in the organization should be able to get their hands on usable data.
